#Battleship

Week 2 at Maker's Academy.

##Context
Battleship was our second week task. Battleship is a game where each player has a board upon which they can place a number of ships. After each player has placed their ships on their own board they take turns to shoot on the opponents board. In each round, each player takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. The opponent announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship, and if it is a hit they mark this on their own primary grid. The attacking player notes the hit or miss on their own tracking grid, in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet. When all of one player's ships have been hit the game finishes and the player who has ships remaining is the winner.

This was the first task that we structured and worked upon completely in a group. As such, this was the first task in which we begun to deploy concepts such as kanban cards and collobarated our work via branching on Github. Our team has collaborated via a repository managed on one team member's account, with everyone assigned as a collaborator. Each morning, we held stand-up meetings to discuss progress, issues, and our approach. We rotated in pairing and started to refactor.
